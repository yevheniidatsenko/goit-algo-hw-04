# Sorting Algorithms

## Introduction

In this homework, we will explore the world of sorting algorithms, a fundamental concept in computer science. We will compare three different sorting algorithms, analyze their efficiency, and draw conclusions about their performance.

## Task Description

### Part 1: Comparing Sorting Algorithms

In this part, you will implement and compare three sorting algorithms: Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, and Timsort. You will use the `timeit` module to measure the execution time of each algorithm on different data sets. Your tasks include:

- Implementing the three sorting algorithms.
- Testing their efficiency on various data sets.
- Measuring the execution time of each algorithm using `timeit`.
- Analyzing the results and drawing conclusions about the performance of each algorithm.

### Part 2: Optional Task - Merging Sorted Lists

In this optional task, you will implement a function `merge_k_lists` that takes a list of sorted lists as input and returns a single sorted list. You can use the merge sorting algorithm as a reference.

#### Example Input and Output

Given:

```python
lists = [[1, 4, 5], [1, 3, 4], [2, 6]]
merged_list = merge_k_lists(lists)
print("Sorted list:", merged_list)
```

Expected Output:

```python
Sorted list: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6]
```

## Goals and Objectives

- Understand the basics of sorting algorithms.
- Implement and compare different sorting algorithms.
- Analyze the efficiency of each algorithm.
- Draw conclusions about the performance of each algorithm.
- Implement a function to merge sorted lists.
